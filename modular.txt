Modularization :

   Yet another named java platform component  , collection of code and data.
   

Why Modularization :

1. Increased encapsulation.
2. Targetting smaller devices
3. Dependency check at runtime , creates dependency graph at initialization time
    (dependency check  not only at compile time but runtime too)
	
	Eg: remove a dependent jar once compiled , java runtime will check the module-info
	 to build the dependency graph


Public is no more public.

a. Export + public
b. Qualified Export
c. Reflection using open on Module and opens on package
d. implied readability or transitive dependency
